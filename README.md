## ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™ƒ Hello, I am Yami. I'm a UI Visual Designer
ðŸŽ¨ My background since 2012 growth has been related to branding, social media and digital illustration but since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and in difficult situations I try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush. 

### What I do
Iâ€™ve worked on projects for brands such as Interbank, Rimac, Mapfre, Wong and my field of expertise lies in the following: I've worked with small, agile teams

ðŸš² When Iâ€™m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/) im really competitive and enjoy all the new things that I discover thanks to my bike I can also be cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now i invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness ðŸŽˆ
