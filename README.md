## 🙃 Hi, my name is Yami and I'm a UI Visual Designer

🎨 My background growth has been related to branding, social media and digital illustration but since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and in difficult situations I try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush. 

### What I do
[My field of expertise wich may be of use to you lies in the following: I’ve worked with small, agile teams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/befutura/) 

🚲 When I’m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike] im really competitive and enjoy all the new things that I discover thanks to my bike (https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/) I can also be cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now i invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness 🎈In my spare time I love to design experimental typography.
