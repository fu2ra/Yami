## ðŸ™ƒ Hi, my name is Yami and I'm a UI Visual Designer

ðŸŽ¨ My background growth has been related to branding, social media and digital illustration but since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and in difficult situations I try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush. 

### What I do
[My field of expertise wich may be of use to you lies in the following: Iâ€™ve worked with small, agile teams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/befutura/) 

ðŸš² When Iâ€™m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/) im really competitive and enjoy all the new things that I discover thanks to my bike I can also be cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now i invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness ðŸŽˆ
