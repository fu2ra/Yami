## ðŸ‘€ Hello, I am Yami. I'm a UI Visual Designer
ðŸŽ¨  My background has grown since 2012 related to branding, social media and digital illustration but since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and in difficult situations I try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush. 

### What I do
Iâ€™ve worked on projects for brands such as Interbank, Rimac, Mapfre, Wong and my field of expertise lies in the following: getting to the core of a brand, create a clean UI design of screens including high fidelity mockups, be able to clearly articulate the rationale behind my design decisions, presentation skill and finally my obsession over colors and details. 

ðŸš² When Iâ€™m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/) im really competitive and enjoy all the new things that I discover thanks to my bike I can also be cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now i invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness ðŸŽˆ
