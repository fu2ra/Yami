## ðŸ™ƒ Hi, my name is Yami I'm a UI Visual Designer

Since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush.[editor on GitHub](https://github.com/fu2ra/profile/edit/master/index.md) 

ðŸš²When Iâ€™m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/), cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now I invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness 

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fu2ra/profile/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### ðŸ’£Lets make great things together
