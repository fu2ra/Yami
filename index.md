### 🙃 Hi, my name is Yami I'm a UI Visual Designer

🎨 Since 3 years ago I feel comfortable with my potential focused on UI design. I usually seek for feedback to improve myself and try not to depend on anyone else to make decisions that need to be taken in a rush. [Im on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/befutura/) 

🚲 When I’m not designing, you can probably find me [ridin' on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/yamicony/), cooking, or learning a new hobby, right now i invest my time reading a lot about ux writing and share practical tools for wealth, health, and happiness 🎈

### Jekyll Themes
